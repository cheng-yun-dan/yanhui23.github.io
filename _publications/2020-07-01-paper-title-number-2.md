Eigen-analysis is widely used in the studies of power system oscillation and small-signal stability. However, it may give inaccurate analyses on subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) when nonlinearity is not negligible. In this paper, a nonlinear analytical approach based on the describing function and generalized Nyquist criterion is proposed to analyze the characteristics of SSO with wind farms. The paper first presents describing function-based model reduction considering key nonlinear elements involved in SSO, and then uses a generalized Nyquist criterion for accurate estimation of SSO amplitude and frequency. The results are verified by time-domain simulations on a detailed model with different scenarios considering variations of the system condition and controller parameters.
