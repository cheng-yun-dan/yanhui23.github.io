Subsynchronous oscillation events of grid-connected voltage source converter (VSC) pose a potential risk to the security and stability of power systems. It is particularly challenging to reveal the subsynchronous oscillation mechanism precisely because the grid-connected VSC consists of non-linear components such as saturation. The describing function and the generalized Nyquist criterion are used in this paper to investigate the bifurcation types and dominant parameters of grid-connected VSC. First, the condition of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation is investigated, which generates subsynchronous oscillations. Then, the dominant parameters of supercritical Hopf bifurcation are deduced, including the grid strength, the active power reference, or the proportional coefficient of phase-locked loop. Finally, it is examined how the saturation's limit value impacts the limit cycle's amplitude and stability. The findings demonstrate that a system's stability depends on whether its closed-loop frequency characteristic curve intersects the describing function's negative reciprocal curve. When the two curves intersect, the supercritical Hopf bifurcation appears, and changing the limit value can affect the limit cycle's amplitude. However, if the two curves do not intersect, altering the limit value cannot cause the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, and the subsynchronous oscillation will not happen. Variations in grid strength, active power reference, or proportional coefficient of phase-locked loop will significantly affect the Nyquist curve, determining if supercritical Hopf bifurcation appears.
