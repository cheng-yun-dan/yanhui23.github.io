Microgrids that contain a high percentage of renewable energy face the challenge of having insufficient resources for long-term regulation of the energy balance. Seasonal hydrogen storage emerges as a promising option. To analyze the feasibility and economic viability of seasonal hydrogen storage in microgrids, this paper proposes a bi-level planning approach.
First, considering the dynamic characteristics of electrolyzer
power-efficiency-degradation, a linearized method for calculating
the dynamic efficiency is proposed. Taking into account the
randomness of the data, a data-driven Markov Chain Monte
Carlo method is used to generate typical daily time series. The
upper level of the bi-level model focuses on investment decisions
for electrolyzer capacity and seasonal hydrogen storage, while
the lower level optimizes system operational revenue and electrolyzer
usage costs. Then, addressing the nonlinear term issue
in optimization calculations, a piecewise McCormick envelope
method considering the power characteristics of the electrolyzer
is proposed to convexify the optimization problem. The results
of the case study show that the proposed planning method can
increase the annual revenue by 11% and 595% compared to only
considering constant efficiency and fixed electrolyzer lifespan.
Additionally, the convex relaxation method enhances convergence
speed while maintaining solution accuracy.
